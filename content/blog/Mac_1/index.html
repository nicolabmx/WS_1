<p>After years of being a PC guy, I got a macbook. That means I had to install some stuff and trying to be a multitasker, I recorded and uploaded it to youtube. Starting with R and RStudio, also Python (it really took 1 minute), and git came already installed. So (spanish speaking alert!!!) here you can check the videos of the installing process and a longer video in which I set git and python in RStudio and test them. Nothing special but got my RStudio working and ready to try new things. Might have some interesting stuff coming for R Beginners next week already.</p>
<p>R &amp; RStudio install:</p>
