<p>Thanks to friends at the “Escuela Politécnica Nacional” in Ecuador, I got the chance to be in front of students after a loooong time off the classroom and talk about <em>Data Science with <code>R</code></em>. Well in front meaning in front of my laptop during a zoom call, but still…</p>
<p>It’s never boring talking about stuff I like, but I gotta admit, sometimes I doubt if my talking/explanations are fulfilling the students’ expectations. Nonetheless, after asking them for anonymous and sincere feedback, I realized that I did quite a good job.</p>
<p>BUT… most recommendations were related to using real data, real examples, same stuff but applied to a real scenario. So, just in case, if you’re reading this and happen to have data that need analyzing/modeling and you would like to have some results presented in a cool way, hit me up, maybe we can join efforts and get a win-win-win-…-win situation.</p>
<p><code>Shiny</code> dashboards and <code>RMarkdown</code> reports were also in the list of recommendations I got. So all in all, I’m happy to see that more people are getting interested in using <code>R</code>. It’s definitely motivating for all of us <code>R</code> users.</p>
<p>In case one or many of the students that were on the call read this, thanks for the opportunity and thanks for allowing me to learn &amp; improve. Hope to get more chances like this one and be able to help, teach and share while learning.</p>
<p>And just for fun:</p>
