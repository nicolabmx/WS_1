<p>As of today, <code>R</code> is one of the most popular languages for Data Science. Being so popular, you can find 18872 packages published on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> as of today. Not to mention all packages that are being developed and can already be used.</p>
<p>Having mentioned this, you would realise that you can find several packages doing similar things and some being better than others. To make your life easier and thanks to a nice conversation I had with friends/colleagues, here’s a list of the fundamental packages you would need for your day by day Data Science.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>tidyverse</code> <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org">(check it out here)</a>: Not really a package but a collection of packages, including <code>readr</code> to read data files, <code>tidyr</code> to get your data tidy, <code>dplyr</code> to manipulate your data and <code>ggplot</code> to create visualizations. Of course there are more but these might be the most used in your daily work.</p></li>
<li><p><code>knitr</code> if you’re thinking on creating reports with <code>RMarkdown</code>. If you’re planning to mix some languages, you can also take a look at <code>quarto</code> <a href="https://quarto.org">(here)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Shiny</code> is the way to go if you want to create dashboards and apps. A whole world of applications can be created. You can start with a small app like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlvz5VG_I24">this</a> (sorry it’s only in spanish). You can also find lots of examples <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/">here</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>plotly</code> <a href="https://plotly.com/r/">(check it out here)</a> will allow you to create interactive graphs (you can also start with ggplot and convert these graphs with <code>ggplotly</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>And last but not least, the <code>tidymodels</code> framework <a href="https://www.tidymodels.org">(check it out here)</a> which you can use to prepare data, create models and summarise results, using the <code>tidyverse</code> principles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there might be some useful packages I’ve forgotten (some are included in the <code>tidyverse</code>) but this list covers most of the things you need to go from zero to hero with data. Start by reading in some data and manipulating it with the <code>tidyverse</code> packages; train, test and get results from models with <code>tidymodels</code>; and create cool visualizations (<code>ggplot</code> and <code>plotly</code>), dashboards (<code>Shiny</code>) and reports (<code>knitr</code> and <code>quarto</code>) to communicate your results.</p>
