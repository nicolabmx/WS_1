  I am a Data Scientist based in Vienna, Austria. I work with R (most of the time) analyzing data, developing models and creating Shiny dashboards. I enjoy riding my bmx and racing when I get the chance.
  
  Back in my home country, lovely Ecuador, I studied mechanical engineering and an MBA. I also did a Data Analysis, Process Improvement and Decision Making (yeap, short name) Master in Spain and a PhD in Management here in Vienna.
  
  I'm always interested in learning, but if given the chance, I enjoy teaching here and there. This is one of the reasons why I created this site. Do check out the blog section for posts about R and anything really.
  
  My picture was taken by mi gf, who is a very talented designer (she even did my home logo).
